Vno Hugo is a simple, responsive theme for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), it's a port of [onevcat](https://github.com/onevcat)'s [Vno - Jekyll](https://github.com/onevcat/vno-jekyll).

See demo [here](https://vno-hugo.netlify.app/).

## Installation
Inside the folder of your Hugo site run:
```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/xslingcn/vno-hugo.git themes/vno-hugo
```
Copy everything in the `exampleSite` folder to the root of your hugo site, then run `hugo serve`. Your site with `Vno Hugo` enabled should be accessible in http://localhost:1313/.

For more information about Hugo, please visit [Hugo's site](https://gohugo.io).

## Configuration

All configuration could be done in `config.yml`. Everything in the config file should be self-explanatory.

If you want to enable MathJax support, set `math` param in the front matter to `true`.

## Background image and avatar

You could replace the background and avatar image in `static/images` folder to change them.
